# Refactoring Suggestions for Image Mixer

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities in the Image Mixer codebase to improve its structure, maintainability, and scalability.

## `App.tsx`

The main `App` component has several areas that could be improved:

*   **Component-specific State:** The `App` component currently manages state for various features, such as prompt optimization (`isOptimizing`, `isModalOpen`, `modalContent`). This state can be encapsulated within more specific components.
    *   **Suggestion:** Create a `PromptOptimizer` component to manage its own state related to optimization.

*   **Error Handling:** The current error handling is basic, relying on a single state for error messages.
    *   **Suggestion:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism. This could involve a dedicated error handling library or a structured approach to display different error types to the user.

*   **Component Size:** The `App` component is large and handles multiple responsibilities.
    *   **Suggestion:** Decompose the `App` component into smaller, more focused components. For example, the "Describe the Mix" card could be extracted into its own component.

*   **Prop Drilling:** Props like `onImageAdd` and `onRemove` are passed down through multiple layers of components.
    *   **Suggestion:** To avoid prop drilling, consider using a state management solution like Redux, Zustand, or React's Context API. This would allow components to access the required state and functions without them being passed down as props.

*   **Magic Strings:** The `localStorage` key `'generatedImages'` is used directly in the code.
    *   **Suggestion:** Store this key in a constant to avoid typos and make it easier to update if needed.

## `services/geminiService.ts`

The `geminiService.ts` file can be made more concise and configurable:

*   **Redundant Error Handling:** The error handling logic in `mixImages` and `optimizePrompt` is nearly identical.
    *   **Suggestion:** Extract the common error handling logic into a reusable function to reduce code duplication.

*   **Hardcoded API URL:** The `API_URL` is hardcoded as `/api`.
    *   **Suggestion:** Move the `API_URL` to an environment variable (e.g., `.env` file) to allow for different environments (development, production) and easier configuration.

## `ImageInputTabs.tsx`

The `ImageInputTabs.tsx` component can be made more scalable:

*   **Switch Statement:** The `renderContent` function uses a `switch` statement to render the active tab's content.
    *   **Suggestion:** For better scalability, replace the `switch` statement with a more dynamic approach, such as a map or a factory function. This will make it easier to add new input modes in the future.

## `types.ts`

The type definitions in `types.ts` can be more precise:

*   **`InputMode` and `ImageSource`:** The `'generated'` type in `InputMode` is conceptually different from the other input modes.
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider adding a boolean flag, such as `isGenerated`, to the `ImageSource` interface to distinguish generated images from user-provided ones. This would make the `InputMode` type more consistent.

## `imageSources.ts`

The `imageSources.ts` file contains static data:

*   **Static Data:** The list of image sources is currently static.
    *   **Suggestion:** For a more dynamic application, this data could be fetched from an API or registered dynamically. This would allow for adding or removing input modes without changing the frontend code.
